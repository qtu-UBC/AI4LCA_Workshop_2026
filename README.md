# AI4LCA Workshop 2026: Deriving Actions for Decarbonization from Verifiable LCAs

## Overview
In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into life cycle assessment (LCA), verifying the integrity and trustworthiness of LCA results has become paramount. This verifiability is the foundation for deriving actionable solutions from LCA to decarbonize business operations, product manufacturing, and supply chain networks through data-driven prioritization and targeted interventions.

We welcome participants from academia, LCA/sustainability consulting firms, AI solution providers, industrial associations and many other groups of the broad LCA/sustainability modeling community, to address this critical challenge. Together, we will explore standardized AI solutions that will transform how we validate LCA and derive actionable insights- making it faster, more consistent, and significantly more scalable. 

This workshop’s conceptual focus examines how verifiability serves as a cornerstone for credible LCA studies and how aligning AI-driven analyses with established standards (such as ISO 14040/44) can build stakeholder trust. Attendees will conduct focused discussions on the best practices in validation and transparency, as well as the definition of actionability in the context of LCA/carbon accounting.

Key outcome of the workshop includes (1) developing a template that captures core reasoning steps in LCA model construction and review (e.g., boundary setting, dataset selection, cutoff rules), (2) developing a small “golden dataset” (i.e., a curated set of LCA modeling questions with expert-annotated answers) for LCA validation

## Agenda
### Keynote
Professor Ming Xu (Tsinghua University): *AI for LCA: From data to implemenation*

### Presentations
- SpiderGen: Towards Procedure Generation fro Carbon Life Cycle Assessments with Generative AI (Anu Sitaraman, Carnegie Mellon University)
- Trace2Cradle: Building Infrastructure for Reliable Carbon Footprinting (Jinliang Xie, Tsinghua University)

### Focused Discussions
#### [Discussion #1] Best practices for validation against ISO 14040/14044
*Details coming soon*

#### [Discussion #2] Define validation dataset for common LCA modeling assumptions
- Format of groundtruth data: We will focus on "Question-Answer" (QA) pairs
- Define tenets to determine when a particular QA pair is acceptable as groundtruth data. This is crucial for maintaining the quality of the groundtruth data
- Explore key categories of LCA modeling practices for which we need groundtruth data
- Develop evaluation matrix for evaluating the quality of the generated QA pairs
