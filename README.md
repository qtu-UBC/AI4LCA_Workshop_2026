# AI4LCA Workshop 2026: Deriving Actions for Decarbonization from Verifiable LCAs

## Overview
In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into life cycle assessment (LCA), verifying the integrity and trustworthiness of LCA results has become paramount. This verifiability is the foundation for deriving actionable solutions from LCA to decarbonize business operations, product manufacturing, and supply chain networks through data-driven prioritization and targeted interventions.

We welcome participants from academia, LCA/sustainability consulting firms, AI solution providers, industrial associations and many other groups of the broad LCA/sustainability modeling community, to address this critical challenge. Together, we will explore standardized AI solutions that will transform how we validate LCA and derive actionable insights- making it faster, more consistent, and significantly more scalable. 

This workshop’s conceptual focus examines how verifiability serves as a cornerstone for credible LCA studies and how aligning AI-driven analyses with established standards (such as ISO 14040/44) can build stakeholder trust. Attendees will conduct focused discussions on the best practices in validation and transparency, as well as the definition of actionability in the context of LCA/carbon accounting.

Key outcome of the workshop include (1) establishing a validation workflow and a standards alignment guideline for AI-augmented LCA, (2) developing a “golden dataset” (a curated set of LCA modeling questions with expert-annotated answers) for LCA validation, and (3) provide a recommendation on the definition of “actionability” in the context of LCA/carbon accounting.
