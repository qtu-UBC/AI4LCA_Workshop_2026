# AI4LCA Workshop 2026: Deriving Actions for Decarbonization from Verifiable LCAs

## Overview
In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into life cycle assessment (LCA), verifying the integrity and trustworthiness of LCA results has become paramount. This verifiability is the foundation for deriving actionable solutions from LCA to decarbonize business operations, product manufacturing, and supply chain networks through data-driven prioritization and targeted interventions.

We welcome participants from academia, LCA/sustainability consulting firms, AI solution providers, industrial associations and many other groups of the broad LCA/sustainability modeling community, to address this critical challenge. Together, we will explore standardized AI solutions that will transform how we validate LCA and derive actionable insights- making it faster, more consistent, and significantly more scalable. 

This workshop’s conceptual focus examines how verifiability serves as a cornerstone for credible LCA studies and how aligning AI-driven analyses with established standards (such as ISO 14040/44) can build stakeholder trust. Attendees will conduct focused discussions on the best practices in validation and transparency, as well as the definition of actionability in the context of LCA/carbon accounting.

Key outcome of the workshop includes (1) developing a template that captures core reasoning steps in LCA model construction and review (e.g., boundary setting, dataset selection, cutoff rules), (2) developing a small “golden dataset” (i.e., a curated set of LCA modeling questions with expert-annotated answers) for LCA validation

- Trace2Cradle: Building Infrastructure for Reliable Carbon Footprinting (Jinliang Xie, Tsinghua University)
- Designing Sustainable Electronics using AI-Driven LCA (Dr. Vikram Iyer, University of Washington)

### Focused Discussions
#### [Discussion #1] Evaluating AI-Assisted LCA & PCF: procedural aspects and standard conformity
- Refine key decision points distilled from ISO 14044 to determine which are most relevant for AI agents versus human practitioners.
- Develop consensus-based quality criteria (rubrics) to assess the performance of AI on these decision points, focusing on reliability, transparency, and relevance.
- Establish standardized evaluation template and checklist to facilitate AI-led and/or human-led verification of procedural and methodological quality.
- Define documentation requirements to ensure traceability of AI decisions, prompts, and data sources.
- Define standard protocol for Goal and Scope statement for contextual embedding of decisions.

#### [Discussion #2] Define validation dataset for common LCA modeling assumptions
- Format of groundtruth data: We will focus on "Question-Answer" (QA) pairs
- Define tenets to determine when a particular QA pair is acceptable as groundtruth data. This is crucial for maintaining the quality of the groundtruth data
- Explore key categories of LCA modeling practices for which we need groundtruth data
- Develop evaluation matrix for evaluating the quality of the generated QA pairs
